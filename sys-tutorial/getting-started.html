        To gain access to the RC systems, users must have two-factor authentication enabled through a Duo account
        <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/division_of_information_technology/security/sc_technologies/mfa.php">(more information here)</a>
        and a SSH client. MacOSX and Linux systems come with a SSH client installed, while Microsoft Windows systems will need one installed.
        We recommend the <a href="https://ccm.net/download/download-1423-ssh-secure-shell-windows">SSH Secure Shell Client</a>,
        as it has a file manager built into it, but users can also use
        <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the Linux/MacOSX/SSH client command line, type in the following command to connect:
        <br/>
        <code style="text-align: center;"> ssh -p 222 username@servername.sc.edu</code>
        where username is the username assigned when your account is created, and servername is the appropriate server host name. Available systems are listed below.

    All systems use SSH on port 222
    </p>
    <p>
        To enable graphical programs on the cluster, add the -X option to the above ssh command.
        This enables transparent forwarding of X applications to your local screen, which directs the communication through an encrypted tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will then be prompted for your password, provided at account creation, and Duo authentication.
        Once authenticated, you will be connected to a login node.
    </p>
    <p>
        After your initial login, change your password using the command <code>passwd</code> on a login node. Your password should contain:
        <li>At least 8 characters</li>
        <li>A mixture of upper and lower case letters</li>
        <li>At least one digit and at least one special characters</li>
